# Zoomable.js

Zoomable is a lightbox for your images, yo! Use it to let users look at
your big, beautiful pictures without opening a new browser tab. You're
thinking, "Isn't there already a bunch of lightboxes just for this
purpose?", and that's where you're wrong. This guy makes sure not to
distract the crap out of your users with all kinds of frilly animations
and whatnot, it just zooms the image up from where it was on the screen.
For what it's worth, this is just an attempt to replicate the
functionality on Medium.com, which is totally the bee's knees.
